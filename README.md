# Smart Classroom App
The Smart Classroom App is a web application developed with Flask server, YOLOv5 for object detection, facial recognition algorithms, and NLP techniques. The primary objective of this app is to automate attendance management and course mapping processes in a classroom setting by leveraging computer vision and natural language processing capabilities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-classroom-attendance.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 model weights and place them in the appropriate directory.
4. Configure the Flask server settings in the config.py file. Set the desired server host, port, and other configurations as per your requirements.
5. Run the Flask server:
```python
 python app.py
```
